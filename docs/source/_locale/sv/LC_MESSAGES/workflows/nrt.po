"Near-Real-Time Forest Disturbance Monitoring (NRT-FDM) entails remote "
"sensing techniques that are based on dense time-series and target the "
"generation of recent disturbance events in forested areas. The main "
"objective is to detect those changes as early as possible. This "
"priotization usually comes at the cost of accuracy, as the methods are "
"optimized for speed and timeliness. They are therefore not suited for "
"area estimations (such as for MRV) where accuracy is the main objective."

"NRT-FDM is a rapidly evolving field of research and many different "
"approaches have been proposed. The most common ones are based on the "
"detection of abrupt changes in the time-series, which are then classified"
" as disturbance events."

"This page provides background information and and a detailed **HOW-TO** "
"for a customised implementation of the CCDC algorithm on the SEPAL "
"platform that is optimized for the generation of near-real-time alerts. "
"It supports various sensor types and satellites, such as medium to very "
"high resolution optical and radar data from Landsat, Sentinel 1 and 2 as "
"well as Planet Labs daily data."

msgid ""
"Originally, the CCDC algorithm is a well-established pixel-based method "
"for the detection of changes in dense time-series and is usually applied "
"for mapping changes of land use and land cover over longer periods of "
"time. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the time-series can "
"be modelled by a harmonic function. The harmonic function is fitted to "
"the time-series and the modelled values are compared to the observations."
" If the difference between the modelled and the observed values exceeds a"
" certain threshold, a break is added, and a new segment is created based "
"on the subsequent observations, fitting a new harmonic model. The "
"threshold for a break is defined as a multiple of the Root-Mean-Square-"
"Error (RMSE) of the harmonic model. You can find more details in the "
"`original article "
"<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425714000248>`_."

"The method implemented in SEPAL is a customised version of that "
"technique, which is optimized for near-real-time alert generation. It "
"consists of 2 elements: 1. A historic reference in the form of a CCDC "
"asset, containing past segments 2. A pixel-wise change detection applied "
"to current imagery and the modelled value of the CCDC asset from 1 year "
"before."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/nrt.rst:20
msgid ""
"The harmonic model of the historic CCDC asset allows to intersect the "
"observations and retrieve a modelled reflectance at any given point in "
"time, a process also called slicing. This information is used for "
"comparison to newly incoming imagery. The observed value from a newly "
"incoming image is compared to the modelled value from exactly 1 year "
"before. This shall ensure that the comparison is always based on the same"
" phenological stage. If the observed value deviates to a certain degree "
"from the historic value, the pixel is flagged as disturbance."

msgid ""
"The degree of deviation is defined as a multiple of the RMSE originating "
"from the harmonic model fitting the observations from a year earlier. "
"Going above that threshhold means a change is initially detected. This "
"value defines the sensitivity of the detection and is expressed as "
"confidence."

"A disturbance event counts as confirmed a number of subsequent "
"observations adhere to the same criteria. This is to avoid false "
"positives. The number of observations in a row is defined by the user. "
"The default is 3."

"The logic of using a comparison to the modelled value from 1 year before "
"has some important implications. A typical user of a NRT-FDM is usually "
"interested in a monitoring period the spans last days to weeks, but not "
"in the entire year (the default value of the monitoring period is 2 "
"months). Changes that happen within the year, but before the monitoring "
"period, would be included. The method therefore introduces a calibration "
"period that directly precedes the monitoring period. Confirmed changes "
"that already happened before or during the calibration period are not "
"included in the final output by default. This is to ensure that the user "
"only receives alerts for changes that happened during the monitoring "
"period. The length of the calibration period is defined by the user. The "
"default is 3 months. The advanced options allow to turn this behaviour "
"off."

"Another advanced option regards the handling of regrowth. Small "
"disturbances from selective logging in tropical forests usually result in"
" a quick canopy closure. By default the algorithms removes those changes "
"as they could originate as well from image artifacts such as re-occuring "
"haze."
