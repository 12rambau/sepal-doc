msgid "A SEPAL recipe is a record of the steps and parameters used to make a dataset (e.g. optical mosaic, radar mosaic, classification, etc.). The recipe can be saved, with the same data recreated on-the-fly whenever needed or used in further analyses. A recipe is not, in itself, data. Using SEPAL recipes enables documentation of the parameters and steps used to create mosaics, composites, classifications, time series and other datasets or information products. SEPAL recipes, once saved, are available in the SEPAL interface after you sign in to the platform. Recipes can be run, deleted, or copied (e.g. to change the sensor used, while leaving all other parameters the same)."
