msgid "A mosaic is a process of combining spatially overlapping images into an individual image. In SEPAL, you can create a composited dataset from Planet images taken at different times. The process can be done using different techniques, for example, you can choose to keep only the pixel value from the first or last image, combine the values of the overlapped pixels using a weighting algorithm, average, or use the maximum or minimum value. In addition, certain preprocessing tasks can be applied to mask clouds/shadows, snow, etc. These operations are complex and repetitive. SEPAL offers you an interactive and intuitive way to create Planet mosaics within any area of interest."
