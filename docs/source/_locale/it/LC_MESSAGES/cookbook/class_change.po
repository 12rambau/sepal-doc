msgid "Very often we want to build the class change map between 2 categorical map sharing the same legend. If the 2 images are taken at different time it will help us understand how the vegetation classification has evolved between these 2 dates. It can be a tidious exercise to build the new legend (forest -> forest, forest -> urban, ...) and to manually write the rules to identify each class. Sepal will automatically build the legend of the rsulting categorical map from the initail legend and compute all the pixels automatically."
