"CCDC is a holistic methodological framework that encompasses various "
"aspects of space-borne, multi-temporal land mapping and monitoring using "
"multi-temporal satellite imagery. The core of the method is a **temporal "
"segmentation** algorithm applied at **pixel-level**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cookbook/ccdc_slice.rst:11
msgid ""
"Before creating a CCDC slice, a CCDC asset needs to be created (as "
"described in :doc:`ccdc`). The asset holds all parameters that are needed"
" to re-produce the modelled time-series of the underlying data. As those "
"parameters are stored at pixel-level we retain the possibility to extract"
" each pixel's modelled reflectance at any given point in time, or for a "
"time-span of the underlying time-series. This is what is meant by "
"**slicing**."

"In addition, we can access the parameters describing the model of the "
