"A mosaic is a combination or fusion of two or more images. In SEPAL, you "
"can create a single raster dataset from several raster datasets by "
"mosaicing them together. This can be achieved on both contiguous rasters "
"(left) and overlapping images (right)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cookbook/optical_mosaic.rst:18
msgid ""
"These overlay areas can be managed in various ways. For example, you can "
"choose to keep only the raster data from the first or last dataset, "
"combine the values of the overlay cells using a weighting algorithm, "
"average the values of the overlay cells, or take the maximum or minimum "
"value. In addition, certain corrections can be made to the image to "
"account for clouds, snow, and other factors. These operations are complex"
" and repetitive. SEPAL offers you an interactive and intuitive way to "
"create mosaics in any area of interest (AOI)."
