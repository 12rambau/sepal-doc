msgid "CCDC is a holistic methodological framework that encompasses various aspects of space-borne, multi-temporal land mapping and monitoring using multi-temporal satellite imagery. The core of the method is a **temporal segmentation** algorithm applied at **pixel-level**. It is furthermore capable to utilize all available **bands** and derived *band ratios*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cookbook/ccdc.rst:11
msgid "CCDC is **data-agnostic**, meaning any type of multi-temporal satellite imagery can be ingested (e.g. optical, radar). SEPAL supports its usage with Landsat, Sentinel-1 & 2 as well as Planet basemaps and daily imagery. Note that for the latter, a Planet API key is necessary."

msgid "The temporal segmentation step starts by fitting a 3rd order harmonic model to each band of the initial part of the time-series. Thereafter, the observations are tested against the model for each band selected as a **breakpoint band**. In case of a significant repetitive deviation from the model, a break is flagged. Subsequently, a new segment is initialized for the upcoming observations until the next break is going to be detected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cookbook/ccdc.rst:15
msgid "A **CCDC asset** retains the information of change(s) happening for each pixel, including the date of the break as well as its magnitude. In addition, the model parameters are stored for the time-series segments in between those breaks. Therefore, another way of thinking about a **CCDC asset** is to consider it as a **condensed, synthetic time-series**. By only storing each segments model parameters, we drastically reduce the storage needs as opposed to store the full-time-series. At the same time, we retain the possibility to re-create the data at any given point in time by using the model's parameters."
