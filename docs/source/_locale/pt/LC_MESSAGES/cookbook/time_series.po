msgid "A Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is a set of satellite images taken of the same scene at different times. A SITS makes use of different satellite sources to obtain a larger data series with a short time interval between two images. In this case, it is fundamental to observe the spatial resolution and registration constraints."

#: ../../source/cookbook/time_series.rst:9
msgid "Satellite observations offer opportunities for understanding how Earth is changing, determining the causes of these changes, and predicting future changes. Remotely-sensed data, combined with information from ecosystem models, offers an opportunity for predicting and understanding the behavior of the Earth's ecosystem. Sensors with high spatial and temporal resolutions make the observation of precise spatio-temporal structures in dynamic scenes more accessible. Temporal components integrated with spectral and spatial dimensions allow the identification of complex patterns concerning applications connected with environmental monitoring and analysis of land cover dynamics."
