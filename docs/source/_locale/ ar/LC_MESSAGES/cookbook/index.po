"Harness high performance cloud-based computing and modern geospatial data"
" infrastructures via SEPAL recipes. They are the main feature of the "
"platform and offer users the ability to quickly and efficiently query and"
" process satellite data, tailor their products for local needs, and "
"produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses."

"A SEPAL recipe is a record of the steps and parameters used to make a "
"dataset (e.g. optical mosaic, radar mosaic, classification, etc.). The "
"recipe can be saved, with the same data re-created, \"on-the-fly\" "
"whenever needed or used in further analyses. A recipe is not, in itself, "
"data. Using SEPAL recipes enables documentation of the parameters and "
"steps used to create mosaics, composites, classifications, time-series "
"and other datasets or information products. SEPAL recipes, once saved, "
"are available in the SEPAL interface after you log in to the platform. "
"Recipes can be run, deleted, or copied (e.g. to change the sensor used, "
"while leaving all other parameters the same)."
