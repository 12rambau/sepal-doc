GEE app reader
==============
*Display the source code of any GEE-based application*

This application allows users to display the source code of any GEE-based application. 

The code is parsed and displayed in the most readable way using the Pygments code highlighter.

Usage
-----

Provide the URL of the application you want to analyse (e.g. https://glad.earthengine.app/view/s2-forest-alerts) and select :btn:`<fa-solid fa-check> Apply`.

Once the code is displayed on your screen, save it in your SEPAL folders by selecting :btn:`<fa-solid fa-floppy-disk> Save`.

Here is an example computing the `GLAD_S2 application <https://glad.earthengine.app/view/s2-forest-alerts#lon=-64.29861048809664;lat=-9.85129363173061;zoom=13>`__:
