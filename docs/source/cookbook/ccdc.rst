CCDC - Asset Creation
=====================

Powered by the API of Google's Earth Engine (link), SEPAL facilitates the workflow for applying the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) approach (link to paper).

CCDC is a holistic methodological framework that encompasses various aspects of land mapping and monitoring by using multi-temporal satellite data. The base is the *temporal segmentation* at *pixel-level* for each image band. This step includes fitting a harmonic model to the observed time-series and detect breaks that indicate a change in land cover or use.





At the same time it is data-agnostic, meaning any type of multi-temporal satellite imagery can be ingested.

capable of realizing various types of land monitoring, starting from the
creation of cloud-free mosaics, land cover and land use classification as well as time-series break detection.

The base for all of those workflows is the creation of a so-called CCDC asset.
