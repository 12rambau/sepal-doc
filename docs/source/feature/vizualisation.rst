Visualization
=============

**Natural color: red, green, blue**
    - **Description**: Represents the true color of the terrain as human eyes would see it, using the red, green, and blue bands.
    - **Usage**: Used for general mapping and visual inspections where true color representation is necessary.

**False color: nir, red, green**
    - **Description**: Uses near-infrared, red, and green bands. Vegetation appears red due to the high reflection of NIR by healthy vegetation, helpful for distinguishing vegetative areas.
    - **Usage**: Commonly used in vegetation studies to easily distinguish live green vegetation, which reflects NIR strongly.

**False color: nir, swir1, red**
    - **Description**: Combines near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and red bands. This combination is effective in highlighting vegetation and differentiating moisture levels and geological features.
    - **Usage**: Useful in geological mapping, vegetation health assessment, and moisture content analysis.

**False color: swir2, nir, red**
    - **Description**: Utilizes short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and red bands. It enhances the differentiation between mineral types and can indicate burn severity in post-fire assessments.
    - **Usage**: Often used in mineralogical mapping, soil and rock differentiation, and detecting burned areas.

**False color: swir2, swir1, red**
    - **Description**: Involves short-wave infrared bands and red band. This setup enhances geological features and is sensitive to water content and urban areas.
    - **Usage**: Ideal for enhanced geological mapping, urban sprawl studies, and discriminating between different water bodies.

**False color: swir2, nir, green**
    - **Description**: Features short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and green bands. This visualization aids in the analysis of vegetation health and soil/water interactions.
    - **Usage**: Useful for detailed vegetation health monitoring and differentiating water stress in plants.

**Tasseled cap: brightness, greenness, wetness**
    - **Description**: Applies the Tasseled Cap transformation to highlight physical properties of the land surface such as brightness (reflectivity), greenness (vegetation), and wetness (moisture content).
    - **Usage**: Extensively used in environmental monitoring, land cover classification, and assessing vegetation and water content dynamics.

**Tasseled cap: fifth, sixth, fourth**
    - **Description**: Another Tasseled Cap visualization focusing on the additional components that might reflect other surface properties not captured by the primary three bands.
    - **Usage**: Useful for specialized studies in vegetation dynamics, soil properties, and other environmental monitoring where standard Tasseled Cap indices might need supplementation.
