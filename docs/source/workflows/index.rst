Workflows
=========

Overview
--------

SEPAL leverages numerous tools and recipes to help users perform data analysis. 

These tools can even be combined in a modular way to execute more complex workflows.

This section presents some workflows that involve using multiple SEPAL tools (modules and/or recipes).

.. note::

    If your workflow is not described here and you would like for it to be included in SEPAL documentation, contact the SEPAL team in the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/openforis/sepal-doc/issues/new/choose>`__.
