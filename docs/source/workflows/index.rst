Workflows
=========
*Combine various SEPAL tools and recipes to perform complex data analyses*

Overview
--------

SEPAL leverages numerous tools and recipes to help users perform data analysis.

These tools can even be combined in a modular way to execute more complex workflows.

The **Workflows** section of SEPAL documentation presents some workflows that involve using multiple SEPAL tools (modules and/or recipes).

.. note::

    If your workflow is not described here and you would like for it to be included in SEPAL documentation, let the SEPAL team know via the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/openforis/sepal-doc/issues/new/choose>`__.
