About the platform
------------------

SEPAL is part of the `Open Foris <http://www.openforis.org>`__ Suite of Tools. The platform allows users to query and process satellite data quickly and efficiently, tailor their products for local needs, and produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses. Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. GEE), the interface enables access and processing of historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europe’s Copernicus program.

SEPAL is a cloud computing-based platform for autonomous land monitoring using remotely sensed data. It is a combination of GEE and open-source software such as GDAL, Jupyter, the Open Foris Geospatial Toolkit, ORFEO Toolbox, Python, R, R Shiny Server, R Studio Server, and SNAP Toolkit. The platform allows users to access powerful cloud-computing resources to query, access and process satellite data quickly and efficiently for creating advanced analyses.
