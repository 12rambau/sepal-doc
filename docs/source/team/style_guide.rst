Style tips
----------
*Here are some basic guidelines for following SEPAL documentation style.*

Focus on user needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider users’ questions and goals when writing SEPAL documentation. 

For every article, make sure users’ questions have been addressed and answered, allowing them to achieve their goals.

Be simple and direct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep language clear, concise and fluid. 

Use section headings to organize articles.

Use numbered and bulleted lists, instead of long paragraphs, whenever possible. 

For simple instructions, use right angle brackets.

Use bold or italic font for emphasis.

Use direct tone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use an active voice, the present tense, the second-person point of view, and the imperative mood.

Tell the user what to do in the moment they are reading the documentation, e.g. Open the SEPAL interface and enter your email address.

Avoid addressing the audience directly, when possible, i.e. limit the use of the words **you** and **your**, e.g. To sign up for a Google account, go to `<https://accounts.google.com/servicelogin>`__

When addressing the audience is necessary, use the word **you** or **your**, e.g. To reset your password, go to `<https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/setup/password.html>`__
