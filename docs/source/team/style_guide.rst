documentation style guide
=========================

    Help us maintain useful, clear, concise, consistent and fluid writing across the documentation by following the SEPAL documentation style guide.

Learn the basics of SEPAL documentation style and ensure that your contributions are as useful as possible for the community.

Goals and principles
--------------------

The goal of SEPAL documentation is to guide users through the SEPAL interface. As an external contributor or a member of the SEPAL team, think of yourself as a tour guide for users.
To achieve this goal, the SEPAL team ensures that writing is:

-   useful
-   clear
-   concise
-   consistent
-   fluid

Style tips
----------

Here are some basic guidelines for following SEPAL documentation style.

Focus on user needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider users’ questions and goals when writing SEPAL documentation. For every article, make sure users’ questions have been addressed and answered, allowing them to achieve their goals.

Be simple and direct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep language clear, concise, consistent and fluid. Prefer bulleted and numbered lists to sentences and paragraphs. When sentences or paragraphs are necessary, prefer short sentences and paragraphs to long sentences and paragraphs. Use section headings to organize articles.

    **Example**

    **Reset password**

    If you have forgotten your password and you have access to the email address associated with your SEPAL account, you can reset it by submitting a request. Simply follow the instructions located on one of the website’s sign-in forms.

    The password reset process can be performed in three steps:

    1.   Provide your email address.
    2.   Complete email verification.
    3.   Create a new password.

For simple step-by-step instructions, use right angle brackets.

    **Example**

    Select **Launch** > **Sign up**

For step-by-step instructions for complex procedures, use numbered and bulleted lists, instead of paragraphs, when possible.

    **Example**

    **To create an account**

    1.   Go to https://sepal.io
    2.   Select **Launch** > **Sign up**.
    3.   Fill out the form.
    4.   Select **Sign up**.
    5.   Complete email verification.
    6.   Create password.

    **Example**

    **To start an instance**

    1.   Examine the **Available instance types** table to choose an instance type.
    2.   Enter your chosen instance type.
    3.   Press **Enter**.
    4.   Wait for the instance to start.

Use a direct tone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing an article, use:

-    an active voice
-    the present tense
-    the second-person point of view
-    the imperative mood

In other words, tell the user what to do in the moment they are reading the documentation.

    **Example**

    Open the **SEPAL interface** and enter your email address.

Avoid addressing the audience directly, when possible (i.e. limit the use of the words **you** and **your**).

    **Example**

    To sign up for a Google account, go to `<https://accounts.google.com/servicelogin>`__

Use an active voice, the present tense, the second-person point of view, and the imperative mood.

In simpler terms: Tell the user what to do in the moment they are reading the documentation (e.g. Open the SEPAL interface and enter your email address.).
Avoid addressing the audience directly, when possible. In other words, limit the use of the words “you” and “your” (e.g. To sign up for a Google account, go to accounts.google.com/servicelogin.).
When addressing the audience is necessary, use the word “you” or “your” (e.g. To reset your password, go to docs.sepal.io/en/latest/setup/password.html.).

Other things to consider
------------------------

Other basic guidelines to follow when writing **SEPAL documentation** include:

-    prefer sentence case over lowercase or all caps;
-    use bold for elements of the **SEPAL interface**, or emphasis (sparingly);
-    use italics for introducing new terminology, or emphasis (sparingly);
-    use punctuation to improve clarity and fluidity;
-    introduce acronyms at first use;
-    present highlighted information strategically and accurately;
-    format file names with lowercase letters and a full stop;
-    format numbers with neither spaces nor punctuation, except for a full stop for decimals;
-    use the author–date system for referencing;
-    introduce lists with an opening phrase ending with a colon, and use consistent capitalization and punctuation; and
-    use the `International System of Units <https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf/2d2b50bf-f2b4-9661-f402-5f9d66e4b507>`__.

Abbreviations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At first mention, acronyms should be written out, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. It may then be used alone.

   **Example**

   The project is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

Abbreviations such as e.g., i.e. and etc. should be avoided; however, when necessary, use them in parentheses (e.g. means "for example"; i.e. means "that is").

Sentence structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use an active voice, the present tense, the second-person point of view, and the imperative mood, whenever possible (e.g. Open the SEPAL interface and enter your email address.).

Capitalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

En-dashes
"""""""""

En-dashes can be used in pairs – leaving a space on either side – to set off an element that is not part of the main sentence. Ideally, they should not be used more than once per paragraph. An en-dash can be used alone to add a phrase elaborating what has gone before – leaving a space on either side. En-dashes are used for relationships, ranges of values, and ranges of dates.

    **Example**

    2016–2020

Full stops
""""""""""

Use full stops at the end of sentences, but not in headings.

    **Example**

    **Set up your accounts and request additional resources**

    In this article, you can learn how to create a SEPAL account.

Hyphens
"""""""

Hyphens can be used: for compound adjectives, when describing ages, amounts or lengths of time, separating a prefix from a date, etc.

    **Example**

    High-quality data for 15 year-old forests.

Quotation marks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*SEPALSTYLE* was developed during copy-editing to improve the presentation of information in the documentation and enhance user experience.

Bold
^^^^
Use bold formatting for the names of buttons, checkboxes, panes, drop-down menus, and other options (e.g. Select Export.).
