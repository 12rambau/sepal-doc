SEPAL documentation style guide
-------------------------------

*Learn the basics of SEPALSTYLE to help maintain useful, clear, concise, consistent and fluid writing.*


Goals and principles
--------------------

The goal of SEPAL documentation is to guide users through the SEPAL interface and help users achieve their goals.

When contributing to SEPAL documentation, think of yourself as a tour guide for SEPAL users.

To help users achieve their goals, writing should be:

-    useful
-    clear
-    concise
-    consistent
-    fluid


Style tips
----------

Basic guidelines for following *SEPALSTYLE* include:

-    Focus on user needs
-    Be simple and direct
-    Use a direct tone

Focus on user needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider user goals and questions when contributing to SEPAL documentation. Define these goals and identify these questions before, during and after making contributions, so that articles can be useful and clear for users.

Ensure user goals are kept in mind when planning, drafting, and finalizing content. Ensure user questions are addressed and answered in the documentation, minimizing confusion and allowing users to achieve their goals.

Be simple and direct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep language clear, concise, consistent and fluid. Prefer bulleted and numbered lists to sentences and pargarphs. When sentences or paragraphs are necessary, prefer short sentences and paragraphs to long sentences and paragraphs. Use section headings to organize articles.

    **Example**
    Reset password
    """"""""""""""
    If you have forgotten your password and you have access to the email address associated with your SEPAL account, you can reset it by submitting a request. Simply follow the instructions located on one of the websiteâ€™s sign-in forms.

    The password reset process can be performed in three steps:

    1.   Provide your email address.
    2.   Complete email verification.
    3.   Create a new password.

For simple step-by-step instructions, use right angle brackets.

    **Example**
    Select **Launch** > **Sign up**

For step-by-step instructions for complex procedures, use numbered and bulleted lists, instead of paragraphs, when possible.

    **Example**
    To create an account

    1.   Go to sepal.io
    2.   Select **Launch** > **Sign up**.
    3.   Fill out the form.
    4.   Select **Sign up**.
    5.   Complete email verification.
    6.   Create password.

    **Example**
    To start an instance

    #    Examine the **Available instance types** table to choose an instance type.
    #    Enter your chosen instance type.
    #    Press **Enter**.
    #    Wait for the instance to start.

Use a direct tone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing an article, utilize: 

-    an active voice 
-    the present tense
-    the second-person point of view
-    the imperative mood

In other words, tell the user what to do in the moment they are reading the documentation.

    **Example**
    Open the SEPAL interface and enter your email address.

Avoid addressing the audience directly, when possible (i.e. limit the use of the words **you** and **your**). 

    **Example**
    To sign up for a Google account, go to `<https://accounts.google.com/servicelogin>`__

When addressing the audience is necessary, use the word **you** or **your**.

    **Example**
    e.g. To reset your password, go to `<https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/setup/password.html>`__
