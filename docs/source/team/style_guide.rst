SEPAL documentation style guide
-------------------------------

*Learn the basics of SEPALSTYLE to help maintain useful, clear, concise, consistent and fluid writing.*


Goals and principles
--------------------

The goal of **SEPAL documentation** is to guide users through the **SEPAL interface** and help users achieve their goals.

When contributing to **SEPAL documentation**, think of yourself as a tour guide for SEPAL users.

To help users achieve their goals, writing should be:

-    useful
-    clear
-    concise
-    consistent
-    fluid

Style tips
----------

Basic guidelines for following *SEPALSTYLE* include:

-    Focus on user needs
-    Be simple and direct
-    Use a direct tone

Focus on user needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider user goals and questions when contributing to **SEPAL documentation**. Define these goals and identify these questions before, during and after making contributions, so that articles can be useful and clear for users.

Ensure user goals are kept in mind when planning, drafting, and finalizing content. Ensure user questions are addressed and answered in the documentation, minimizing confusion and allowing users to achieve their goals.

Be simple and direct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep language clear, concise, consistent and fluid. Prefer bulleted and numbered lists to sentences and paragraphs. When sentences or paragraphs are necessary, prefer short sentences and paragraphs to long sentences and paragraphs. Use section headings to organize articles.

    **Example**
    **Reset password**
    If you have forgotten your password and you have access to the email address associated with your SEPAL account, you can reset it by submitting a request. Simply follow the instructions located on one of the website’s sign-in forms.

    The password reset process can be performed in three steps:

    1.   Provide your email address.
    2.   Complete email verification.
    3.   Create a new password.

For simple step-by-step instructions, use right angle brackets.

    **Example**
    Select **Launch** > **Sign up**

For step-by-step instructions for complex procedures, use numbered and bulleted lists, instead of paragraphs, when possible.

    **Example**
    **To create an account**

    1.   Go to sepal.io
    2.   Select **Launch** > **Sign up**.
    3.   Fill out the form.
    4.   Select **Sign up**.
    5.   Complete email verification.
    6.   Create password.

    **Example**
    **To start an instance**

    1.   Examine the **Available instance types** table to choose an instance type.
    2.   Enter your chosen instance type.
    3.   Press **Enter**.
    4.   Wait for the instance to start.

Use a direct tone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing an article, utilize: 

-    an active voice 
-    the present tense
-    the second-person point of view
-    the imperative mood

In other words, tell the user what to do in the moment they are reading the documentation.

    **Example**
    Open the **SEPAL interface** and enter your email address.

Avoid addressing the audience directly, when possible (i.e. limit the use of the words **you** and **your**).

    **Example**
    To sign up for a Google account, go to `<https://accounts.google.com/servicelogin>`__

When addressing the audience is necessary, use the word **you** or **your**.

    **Example**
    To reset your password, go to `<https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/setup/password.html>`__


Key terminology
---------------

Common terms used in **SEPAL documentation** include:

Other things to consider
------------------------

Other basic guidelines to follow when writing **SEPAL documentation** include:

-    prefer sentence case over lowercase or all caps;
-    use bold for elements of the **SEPAL interface**, or emphasis (sparingly);
-    use italics for introducing new terminology, or emphasis (sparingly);
-    use punctuation to improve clarity and fluidity;
-    introduce acronyms at first use;
-    present highlighted information strategically and accurately; 
-    format file names with lowercase letters and a full stop;
-    format numbers with neither spaces nor punctuation, except for a full stop for decimals;
-    use the author–date system for referencing;
-    introduce lists with an opening phrase ending with a colon, and use consistent capitalization and punctuation; and
-    use the International System of Units.

Abbreviations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At first mention, acronyms should be written out, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. It may then be used alone.

   **Example**
   The project is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

Abbreviations such as e.g., i.e. and etc. should be avoided; however, when necessary, use them in parentheses (e.g. means "for example"; i.e. means "that is").

   **Example**
   Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. GEE), the interface enables access and processing of historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europe’s Copernicus program.

Font
^^^^

Bold
""""

Use bold formatting for the names of elements in the **SEPAL interface**, or emphasis.

    **Example**
    Select **Export**.

Capitalization
""""""""""""""

Use sentence case (i.e. capitals only for the initial letter of the phrase and any proper nouns), except when mirroring appearance of text in the **SEPAL interface**. For proper nouns, follow initial capitalization.

    **Example**
    **Area of interest selection**
    The area of interest (AOI) is the first mandatory input in the majority of SEPAL modules.

Italics
"""""""

Use italicized text for introducing key terminology at first mention, or emphasis.

    **Example**
    There is *formal QA/QC* and *informal QA/QC*. Formal QA/QC refers to ..., while informal QA/QC refers to ...


Punctuation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Colons
""""""
Use colons to introduce lists, definitions, explanations or quotations.

    **Example**
    In this section of **SEPAL documentation**, you can learn how to:
    -   Register to SEPAL
    -   Use Google Earth Engine (GEE) with SEPAL
    -   Use Norway’s International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI) - Planet Lab data
    -   Exchange files with SEPAL
    -   Manage your resources
    -   Reset your password

Commas
""""""

A comma may separate two independent clauses before a conjunction, separate two independent clauses before a conjunction, set off complementary information, be used before the final "and" in a list to avoid ambiguity, or be used where a sentence comprises a complex series of phrases.

    **Example**
    By default, SEPAL is in English, but is also available in other languages, such as French and Spanish.

En-dashes
"""""""""

En-dashes can be used in pairs – leaving a space on either side – to set off an element that is not part of the main sentence. Ideally, they should not be used more than once per paragraph. An en-dash can be used alone to add a phrase elaborating what has gone before – leaving a space on either side. En-dashes are used for relationships, ranges of values, and ranges of dates.

    **Example**
    2016–2020

Full stops
""""""""""

Use full stops at the end of sentences, but not in headings.

    **Example**
    **Set up your accounts and request additional resources**
    In this article, you can learn how to create a SEPAL account.

Hyphens
"""""""

Hyphens can be used: for compound adjectives, when describing ages, amounts or lengths of time, separating a prefix from a date, etc. 

    **Example**
    High-quality data for 15 year-old forests.

Quotation marks
"""""""""""""""

Use double quotation marks for direct quotes (e.g. for the text displayed in an error message).

    **Example**
    If the following error message is displayed, continue to Step 2: "Can't open file. No such file or directory."

Semicolons
""""""""""

Use semicolons to separate independent clauses that have different subjects and are not connected by a conjunction; in long sentences comprising a series of complex clauses, at least one of which contains a comma, semicolons may replace commas.

    **Example**
    These overlay areas can be managed in various ways. For example, you can choose to:
    -   keep only the raster data from the first or last dataset;
    -   combine the values of the overlay cells using a weighting algorithm;
    -   average the values of the overlay cells; or
    -   take the maximum or minimum value.

File names
^^^^^^^^^^

Format file names with a full stop and lowercase file type.

   **Example**
   .tiff

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Common terms for showcasing information include:

-   Tip
-   Note
-   Attention
-   Important

Numbers
^^^^^^^

To avoid confusion, format numbers with neither spaces nor punctuation, except for a full stop for decimals.

   **Example**
   10000 hectares

   **Example**
   0.175 m

Generally, numbers from one to ten are written in text as words; numbers from 11 upward are written as numerals. Use arabic numerals for dates, percentages, money, measurements, ages, ratios and scales. Write out any number that begins a sentence. Use numerals where a number accompanies a unit.

Paragraph
^^^^^^^^^

Lists
"""""

When presenting bulleted and numbered lists, introduce them with an opening phrase ending with a colon.

For very short entries, the list items are lower case with no punctuation.

   **Example**
   Select one of the following categories:
   -   background
   -   foreground
   -   special background 1

For longer entries, the list items are lower case and end with a semi-colon; the final entry should end with a semicolon and the word "and".

   **Example**
   To open an account:
   -   go to the website;
   -   enter your credentials; and
   -   complete email verification.

For entries that are complete sentences, the list items are sentence case and end with a full stop.

   **Example**
   Keep the following in mind:

   -   The transition of land cover over time provides important insights into how land characteristics have changed.
   -   Trends in land productivity measure important changes in productivity over time.
   -   Changes in above ground and below ground carbon stocks are currently shown by soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks.

Referencing
^^^^^^^^^^^

When referencing source material, use the author–date system, which includes in-text citations and a reference list with all sources at the end of the article.

   **Example**
   In 2008, GuidosToolbox was developed as a graphical user interface (GUI) to Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) of raster data (Soille and Vogt 2009).

   **Example**
   **References**
   Soille, P. and Vogt, P. 2009. Morphological segmentation of binary patterns. *Pattern Recognition Letters*, 30(4): 456–459. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2008.10.015

Units
^^^^^

Use the International System of Units. Do not use punctuation or letter spacing; however, always insert a space between the unit and the number. If using symbols, introduce at first use in parentheses.

   **Example**
   Information is gathered every 5 metres (m). Every 50 m, a report is generated.
