Google Classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To provide consistent, up-to-date training materials, the SEPAL team uses the Google Classroom platform, which allows us to easily update and share materials with the whole team.

Open your professional Google account and go to the `Google Classroom page <https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h>`_. You should see something like the following image, minus the classes:

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/dashboard.png

Each class is composed of several :code:`Topics`. Each topic can include different types of material, including: :code:`exercices`, :code:`exams`, and :code:`material`, as presented in the image below:

    If you need support with the SEPAL team's Google Classroom material, contact :email:`Aurelie shapiro <aurelie.shapiro@fao.org>` and :email:`Pierrick Rambaud <pierrick.rambaud@fao.org>`, who will respond as soon as possible.

Creating a classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need material for a webinar, you can either reuse one of the general classrooms or create your own by following the steps presented in the following tutorial:

.. youtube:: pl-tBjAM9g4

.. tip::

    If you create your own course as a combination of different modules, invite :email:`sepal.classrom@gmail.com` as a teacher and make this account the owner of the classroom. You will still be able to do everything as a teacher, but the content will be stored in a communal account.

When creating basic content, you can reuse posts from other classes you are teaching, as shown in the following image:

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/new-post.png

.. attention::

    If you want to reuse material from other classes, you will need to be added as a teacher on these classes by contacting :email:`Aurelie shapiro <aurelie.shapiro@fao.org>` and :email:`Pierrick Rambaud <pierrick.rambaud@fao.org>`.

.. attention::

    To avoid duplicate copies of content, do not select the option to copy all attachments.

Use general content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use general content in your classrooms, you need to add the general content folder to your Google Drive account. (Note: Google only offers the opportunity to create shortcuts to other Google Drive accounts, which is not sufficient in our case.)

Open Google Drive and go to the **Share with me** section. Select the **General Class Content** folder.

.. note::

    If the content has not yet been shared with you, ask your colleagues to do so.

Press :code:`maj+Z`. You should see the following pop-up window. By selecting **Add**, the folder will connect to your own Google Drive account.

To reuse a file from this folder, edit the classroom content:

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/edit.png

Then add a file from Google Drive (to make sure that you're reusing an already existing file):

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/add-file.png

.. note::

    The file you're using is made for general purposes and should not be adapted to your specific needs. Making modifications to the original is permitted if you're improving the quality of the presentation; however, any other modifications should be made in another version, which you can create by copying the original to your Google Drive account.

.. attention::

    Since all SEPAL team members have the right to edit this file and mistakes could impact all of us, as well as all existing classrooms that use this file, please exercise caution.
