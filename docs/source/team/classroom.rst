*Learn how to use SEPAL's Google Classroom*

Usage
-----

To provide consistent, up-to-date training materials, the SEPAL team uses Google Classroom.

To access SEPAL's Google Classroom, open your professional Google account and go to `the SEPAL project's Google Classroom page <https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h>`_ (you should see something like the following image, except for the classes).

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/dashboard.png

Each class is composed of several :code:`Topics`.

Each **Topic** can include different types of content, including: :code:`exercises`, :code:`exams`, and :code:`material`.

Creating a classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need material for a webinar, you can either reuse one of the general classrooms or create your own by following the steps presented in the following tutorial.

.. youtube:: pl-tBjAM9g4

.. tip::

    If you create your own course as a combination of different modules, invite :email:`sepal.classroom@gmail.com` as a teacher and make this account the owner of the classroom. You will still be able to do everything as a teacher, but the content will be stored in a communal account.

When creating basic content, you can reuse posts from other classes that you are teaching.

.. tip::

    If you want to reuse material from other classes, you will need to be added as a teacher for these classes by contacting :email:`Aurelie Shapiro <aurelie.shapiro@fao.org>` and :email:`Pierrick Rambaud <pierrick.rambaud@fao.org>`.

.. attention::

    To avoid duplicate copies of content, please *do not* select the option to **Create new copies of all attachments**.

Use general content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use general content in your classrooms, add the **General class content** folder to your Google Drive account.

Open **Google Drive** and go to the **Share with me** section.

Select the **General class content** folder.

.. note::

    If the content has not yet been shared with you, ask your colleagues to do so.

Enter :code:`maj+Z`.

Select **Add** to connect the folder to your own Google Drive account.

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/pop-up.png

To reuse a file from this folder, use the **Edit** function.

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/edit.png

Then, add a file from Google Drive:
