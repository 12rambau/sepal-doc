Google Classroom
================
*Learn how to use SEPAL's Google Classroom*

Usage
-----

To provide consistent, up-to-date training materials, the SEPAL team uses the Google Classroom platform.

To access Google Classroom for SEPAL, open your professional Google account and go to `the SEPAL project's Google Classroom page <https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h>`_ (you should see something like the following image, except for the classes).

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/dashboard.png

Each class is composed of several :code:`Topics`.

Each **Topic** can include different types of content, including: :code:`exercices`, :code:`exams`, and :code:`material` (see following image).

    If you need support with Google Classroom for SEPAL, contact :email:`Aurelie Shapiro <aurelie.shapiro@fao.org>` and :email:`Pierrick Rambaud <pierrick.rambaud@fao.org>`.

Creating a classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need material for a webinar, you can either reuse one of the general classrooms or create your own by following the steps presented in the following tutorial.

.. youtube:: pl-tBjAM9g4

.. tip::

    If you create your own course as a combination of different modules, invite :email:`sepal.classroom@gmail.com` as a teacher and make this account the owner of the classroom. You will still be able to do everything as a teacher, but the content will be stored in a communal account.

When creating basic content, you can reuse posts from other classes that you are teaching (see following image).

.. attention::

    If you want to reuse material from other classes, you will need to be added as a teacher for these classes by contacting :email:`Aurelie Shapiro <aurelie.shapiro@fao.org>` and :email:`Pierrick Rambaud <pierrick.rambaud@fao.org>`.

.. attention::

    To avoid duplicate copies of content, *do not* select the option to **Create new copies of all attachments**.

Use general content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use general content in your classrooms, add the general content folder to your Google Drive account. (Note: Google only allows users to create shortcuts to other Google Drive accounts, which is not sufficient.)

Open **Google Drive** and go to the **Share with me** section.

Select the **General class content** folder.

.. note::

    If the content has not yet been shared with you, ask your colleagues to do so.

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/shared-with-me.png

Enter :code:`maj+Z`.

Select **Add** to connect the folder your own Google Drive account (see following image).

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/pop-up.png

To reuse a file from this folder, **Edit** classroom content (see following image).

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/edit.png

Then, add a file from Google Drive (to make sure that you're reusing an already existing file):

.. image:: ../_images/team/classroom/add-file.png

.. note::

    The file you're using is made for general purposes and should not be adapted to your specific needs. If you're improving the quality of the presentation, making modifications to the original is permitted; however, any other modifications should be made in another version, which you can create by copying the original to your Google Drive account.

.. important::

    Since everyone on the SEPAL team can edit this file, mistakes could impact all members and existing classrooms that use this file. Please exercise caution.
