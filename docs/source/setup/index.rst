Getting started with SEPAL
==========================

Introduction
------------

In this section of our documentation you'll find the key requirement to use the plateform. We'll start from :doc:`register` to the more advanced :doc:`filezilla`. use the left pannel to navigate in this section of the documentation. 
If you don't find what you need please let us know using the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/openforis/sepal-doc/issues/new/choose>`_ of this very website.

We will be happy to receive contribution from people that use this documentation, so if you find a typo, don't hesitate to use the :code:`edit this page` button on the right side of every documentation page to help us improve the way we present the platform!
