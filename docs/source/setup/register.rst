.. tip:: 

    Once you sign up for SEPAL, you can request access to the Sepal Users Google Group by following this `link <https://groups.google.com/g/sepal-users>`_ and clicking on the button, :guilabel:`Ask to join group`. 
    If you need help, navigate to the `GIS.StackExchange <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sepal>`_ platform and ask a question to the community using the :guilabel:`sepal` tag. Your question might be useful to others! 


With this fresh account, you can perform some basic operations, such as recipes (not retrieve), visualization or navigating through the platform. To get full access, go to :ref:`request access section <request>`.

.. note:: Even though you are now logged into the platform, some of the SEPAL features are not fully available â€”see the left tabs bar: :btn:`<fas fa-terminal> terminal` and :btn:`<fas fa-wrench> tools` buttons are deactivated, this is because these functions require an instance (check how to instantiate an instance) and a quota (:ref:`see how to request quota resources <request>`).

.. _request:

Request resources (quota)
-------------------------

Requesting processing resources will allow you to use all the modules built into SEPAL, development tools as Jupyter or RStudio, as well as access to the command line terminal. 

To request resources, click the quota button that is located in the bottom right corner, and click the green button :btn:`<fas fa-pencil-alt> Request additional resources`, a form asking you for the limits (instance, storing and storage) and a message that will be read by the platform administators. If you are not sure how many resources you will use, please visit the `resource management <resource>`_ section, where more detailed info can be found.

You will need to have a Google email address to sign up for GEE. If you don't have one already, you can sign up here: http://mail.google.com/mail/sign-up. 

With your Google email address, you can request a GEE account by visiting https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/.
