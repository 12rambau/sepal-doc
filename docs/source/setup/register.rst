Register with SEPAL
===================

Request access to the interface and sign up for other services 
--------------------------------------------------------------

The first step to using SEPAL is requesting access to the platform on the project website. To unlock the full potential of the interface, you can register with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Collect Earth Online (CEO), both available free of charge.

Sign up for SEPAL
-----------------

.. note::

    Registration with SEPAL is required to use the platform.

You can request access to SEPAL by visiting `sepal.io <sepal.io>`_, clicking :code:`Sign up`, and completing the Google Form. You will be asked to provide:

-   your email address
-   your name
-   your institution
-   your country
-   a brief explanation of what you intend to do with the platform

Once submitted, platform administrators will review your application. If approved, you will receive notification within approximately 1 to 3 days.

.. note::

    Applications are evaluated by the administrators to prevent bots and malicious users from accessing the platform. Incomplete registration forms will be refused.

.. tip:: 

    Once you sign up for SEPAL, you can request access to the Sepal Users Google Group by following this `link <https://groups.google.com/g/sepal-users>`_ and clicking on the button, :guilabel:`Ask to join group`. 
    If you need help, navigate to the `GIS.StackExchange <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sepal>`_ platform and ask a question to the community using the :guilabel:`sepal` tag. Your question might be useful to others! 

Sign up for Google Earth Engine (GEE)
-------------------------------------

.. note::

    This step is not required. SEPAL can run computation on its own GEE account on your behalf. However, we highly recommend signing up for this service to improve your experience.

You will need to have a Google email address to sign up for GEE. If you don't have one already, you can sign up here: http://mail.google.com/mail/sign-up. 

With your Google email address, you can request a GEE account by visiting https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/.

    If you experience problems registering with GEE, contact the SEPAL team for assistance.

Sign up for Collect Earth Online (CEO)
--------------------------------------

.. note::

    This step is not required. However, to get the most out of our classification and validation tools, we highly recommend using CEO for collecting point-based training and validation data.

You can access CEO in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge by navigating to https://collect.earth/ and clicking on :code:`Login/Register` in the upper-right corner. After clicking on :code:`Register a new account` and following the instructions, you can log in with your **email** and **password**.
