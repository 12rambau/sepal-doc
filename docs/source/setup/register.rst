.. tip::

    After completing registration, request access to the **SEPAL Users Google Group** by going to <https://groups.google.com/g/sepal-users>`__ and selecting **Ask to join group**.

    For support, go to the `GIS StackExchange <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sepal>`__ and ask a question to the community using the **SEPAL** tag.

.. note:: With your new account, you can perform basic operations, such as visualizing and processing satellite imagery, saving recipes, and navigating through the platform. However, some SEPAL features are not fully available (e.g. The **Terminal** and **Tools** buttons – located in the vertical **Tabs** bar on the left – are deactivated because these functions require an **instance** and a **quota**). To receive full access, go to the :ref:`Request access <request>` section.

.. _request:

Request additional SEPAL resources
----------------------------------
(Recommended)

To use SEPAL modules and acesss the command line terminal and development tools like Jupyter or RStudio, you will need to request processing resources.

1.  Select the **User report** button in the lower-right corner (i.e. **$ 0/h**).
2.  Select :btn:`<fa-solid fa-pencil> Request additional resources`.
3.  Complete the form and select :btn:`<fa-solid fa-check> Apply`.

If you do not know how many resources you will use, go to the `Resource management <resource>` section for more information.

.. _gee:

Sign up for GEE
---------------
(Recommended)

.. note::

    While SEPAL can run computation on its own Google Earth Engine (GEE) account on your behalf, the SEPAL team highly recommends signing up for GEE to improve your experience.

If you already have a Google email address, sign up for a GEE account by going to https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup.

If you don't have a Google email address, sign up by going to http://mail.google.com/mail/sign-up.

Once you have a GEE account, access the interface by going to https://code.earthengine.google.com.

    If you experience problems registering with GEE, `ask the community <https://groups.google.com/g/sepal-users>`__.

.. _ceo:

Sign up for CEO
---------------

3.  Select **Register**.
