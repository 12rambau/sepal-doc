Sepal is by default in English, but is also available in several languages such as French and Spanish. To use these language in sepal come back to the launch page. (disconnect yourself if necessary). On this page click on :code:`Launch`.

Once y'ouve clicked, you will access the login page. At the top-right side of this panel, click on the btn corresponding to your language :
